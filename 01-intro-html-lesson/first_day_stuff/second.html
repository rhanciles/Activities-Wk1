                <li>It was an interesting first day. Decided to log in early and I got the message <i>"your host will let you in"</i> when I logged on to Zoom. A bit bewildered, I signed out and signed in again thinking I might have clicked on the wrong link. Same error. Then I reached out to one of the SSMs who told me it was fine; the session was yet to commence. Phew! Never thought the lessons would be starting in the nick of time</li><br/>
                <li>Also got a bit confused about the GitLab which I had never used, only to discover I already had a login for it. I guess with all of the exercises revolving around GitHub,'Lab' the junior brother became a case of out-of-sight, out-of-mind. Got there in the end and once that was sorted, I was good to go</li><br/>
                <li>No prizes for guessing that the whole saga of homework and assignments now unfolds. Not that I am complaining, just twiddling my fingers right now trying to wrap my head around the first one. How do I make a sandwich?</li>

          <b><i>My typical sandwich would be:</i></b>
              <ol>
                <li>Two slices of Tesco’s ‘Toastie’ (Gosh, I love that bread)</li>
                <li>Toasted to a golden brown colour and richly buttered</li>
                <li>A layer of freshly fried omelette (golden brown)</li>
                <li>With a slice of cheese and ham to go with it. </li>

          <i>That’s me sorted. Although I might just make it four slices if the demons in my tummy are suddenly up for a fight and I can tell you they are an unruly bunch.</i>
